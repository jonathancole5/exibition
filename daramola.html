		<h2>Interview Transcript</h2>
		<p>For History, we were tasked with interviewing someone
		of our choice that was over the age of 25.<br> 
		We asked them questions in regards to their 
		life. Then, after we had taken the interview, we were to
		type up the entire interview into a transcript.
